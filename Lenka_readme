My scaleway server.

It's THE server running in the private cloud.
And I need to remember how to access it.
Because there is some problem installing npm and Toni thinks
it's gonna get fixed if I use this My scaleway server,
which is paid.

The access:

run ssh root@51.15.134.235

(That's the IP address to connect to.)

There is my public ssh key, which I should try not to overwrite.
So it should not ask me for a password.

TIL: how to get youtube API key
go to console.developers.google.com, search for APIs and services,
search for youtube api search v3, go to credentials and generate API key.

This api key put as a constant const API_KEY = 'the key' into index.html

And also download one package: npm install --save youtube-api-search
The --save means that it gets saved into package.json file

SEARCH BAR

file: search_bar.js
